        <p>In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML, to get you
          started. We define elements, attributes, and all the other important
          terms you may have heard, and where they fit into the language.
          We also show how an HTML element is structured, how a typical HTML
          page is structured, and explain other important basic language features.
          Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="html">
        <header>What is HTML?</header>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup
          language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can
          be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists
          of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts
          of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make
          a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words,
          and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</p>
        <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by
          enclosing it in a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:</p>
        <code>&lt;p>My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="nesting_html">
        <header>Nesting HTML</header>
        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to
          state that our cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element,
            which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;<strong>very</strong>&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above,
          we opened the <span class="grey-box">p</span> element first, then the <span class="grey-box">strong</span>
          element, therefore we have to close the <span class="grey-box">strong</span> element first, then
          the <span class="grey-box">p</span>. The following is incorrect:</p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
        <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another.
          If they overlap like above, then your web browser will try to make a best guess at what you were trying
          to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
    </section>


    <section class="main-section" id="empty_elements">
        <header>Empty Elements</header>
        <p>Some elements have no content, and are called empty elements. Take the &lt;img&gt; element we already have
          in our HTML:</p>
        <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
        <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;/img&gt; tag, and no inner content. This is because
          an image element doesn't wrap content to have an effect on it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML
          page in the place it appears.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="html_anatomy">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
        <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't very useful on their own. Now we'll
          look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into
          our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):</p>
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html&gt;<br> &lt;head><br>  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>  &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
          <br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;
          <br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
        <p>Here we have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="grey-box">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> — the doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (about 1991/2),
            doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which
            could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days no one really cares about them, and they
            are really just a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything to work right. For now, that's all you need
            to know.</li><br>
          <li><span class="grey-box">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span> — the <span class="grey-box">&lt;html&gt;</span> element. This
            element wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.</li><br>
          <li><span class="grey-box">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span> — the <span class="grey-box">&lt;head&gt;</span> element. This
            element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing
            to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results,
            CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li><br>
          <li><span class="grey-box">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span> — this element sets the character set your document should
            use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. Essentially it can now
            handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems
            later on.</li><br>
          <li><span class="grey-box">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span> — the <span class="grey-box">&lt;title&gt;</span> element.
            This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also
            used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.</li><br>
          <li><span class="grey-box">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span><span> — the <span class="grey-box">&lt;body&gt;</span> element.
            This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text,
            images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
        </ul>
